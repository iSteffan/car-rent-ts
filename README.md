<p>Welcome to my car rental services website!</p>

</br>
<p>The website consists of three pages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Home page with a general description of the services provided by the company.</li>
<li>A car catalog page with cars of various configurations that users can filter by brand, hourly rental price, and mileage covered by the car during its use.</li>
<li>A page with advertisements that have been added to favorites by the user.</li></ol>
  
<p>On the first page of the catalog, 8 advertisements are rendered, and the rest can be loaded by clicking the "Load more" button.</p>
<p>Clicking the "heart" button on an advertisement card adds or removes it from the favorites list.</p>
<p>Clicking the "Learn more" button opens a modal window with detailed information about the car and its rental conditions.</p>

<p>I use the mockapi service as my database with the following data structure:</p>
